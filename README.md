Comments:
Unfortunately was not able to fully complete all user stories within given time frame.
Do refer to my Trello board link to track my progress and comments throughout the week.

Application styling is kept to a minimum, focus was placed more on ensuring features and functionalities perform correctly.
Typescript implementation is not the best, will require more experience/guidance on properly handling typing for some scenarios.
Please do let me know if any bugs/unintended behaviour is spotted, so that i can address it in subsequent updates.

If given more time, next priority will be to implement SSL Certificates and Unit testing scenarios for the application.
